# Web-Development
This repository contains my collection of web development code pieces and practice projects built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with frontend technologies like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I use this space to share solutions, small projects, and reusable snippets.
